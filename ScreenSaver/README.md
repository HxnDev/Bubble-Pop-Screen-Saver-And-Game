# Screen Saver

We were required to create desktop screen saver having moving shapes (like Circle, Rectangle, Square or even Triangle, whereas other shapes can be found using below URL). Shapes should have
•     different size (height,width/radius)
•     different colors
•     different starting location
•     different direction of movement
•     different speed  of movement

A shape should reflect after striking with the boundary/wall if the boundary/wall is touched by it. àTwo shapes of different colors should change their direction if they collide with each other. àWhen two same shapes of same color (like two circles with red color) collide with each other, they should result in 1 shape/output (i.e. one of them is deleted/dropped)
