# Bubble Pop Game

User selects any one color by taking input (may be at the start of the program), the task is to touch the balloons of this very color only to get points. If user clicks a shape of any other color then points are decremented.  You can set a time for this game, where total points are displayed at the end of the game. Below diagram may provide you some help (do not get confused with shape of hand, you can use mouse- not 100% demo of above requirements.)
If  user  drags  a  shape  and  make  it  collide  it  with  another  same  shape  of  same  color,  then  the resulting output should be same shape of bigger size.
Bonus:  If certain shape of same color, reaches a certain size (i.e. by merging/grouping more than 3 shapes) then it should split back into 3 same shape of original sizes.
